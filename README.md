# ltz

An all purpose, simple, lightweight CLT that helps create projects on the fly
    
## Installation - This only works on Mac/Linux right now!

### First Method - Git
1. Clone this repo into your Home directory

        $ git clone github.com/Ninjacop/ltz.git

3. Go into terminal and type these commands

        $ cd ~/ltz/bin

        $ open ltz

This will open a seperate Terminal window, so once it is done, quit out of terminal (Command-Q for all who don't remember)

4. Open up a new terminal window and you're all set and ready to go!

### Second Method - Downloading the .zip
1. So if you don't have git, you can download a zip of the current build

2. Unzip the build in your Home directory 

3. Go into terminal and type these commands

        $ cd ~/ltz/bin

        $ open ltz

This will open a seperate Terminal window, so once it is done, quit out of terminal (Command-Q for all who don't remember)

4. Open up a new terminal window and you're all set and ready to go!
